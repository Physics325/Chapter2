    "\n",
    "People usually borrow money from the bank to buy a house, which is called a mortgage.  When you have a mortgage you pay a fixed amount each month.  Your monthly payment was determined at the beginning of the loan, based on the borrowed amount, the length of time for the loan (eg. the number of payments), and the interest rate.  When interest rates drop during the life of a mortgage, you can \"re-finance\", which means you essentially borrow money to pay off your existing mortgage.  You then make monthly payments on the new loan. The advantage is that the new payments are lower because the interest rate is lower.  The disadvantage is that you are often charged a flat fee (\"closing costs\") to make the new loan.  So, the accumulated cost of your current mortgage is your current monthly payment times the number of months:\n",

    "\n",
    "Cost_new(N) = payment_new * N + closing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, Cost_new will be larger than Cost_old, because of the closing cost.  But over time, the accumulated cost of the new mortgage will be less than teh old mortgage, because of the lower monthly payments.  (Plot each of these functions to convince yourself this is true.)  For the following parameters, find your \"break even time\", the number of payments at which the new mortgage starts to be less than the old mortgage: \n",
