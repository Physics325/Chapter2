      "People usually borrow money from the bank to buy a house, which is called a mortgage.  When you have a mortgage you pay a fixed amount each month.  Your monthly payment was determined at the beginning of the loan, based on the borrowed amount, the length of time for the loan (eg. the number of payments), and the interest rate.  When interest rates drop during the life of a mortgage, you can \"re-finance\", which means you essentially borrow money to pay off your existing mortgage.  You then make monthly payments on the new loan. The advantage is that the new payments are lower because the interest rate is lower.  The disadvantage is that you are often charged a flat fee (\"closing costs\") to make the new loan.  So, the accumulated cost of your current mortgage is your current monthly payment times the number of months:\n",

      "### Comparing Integration methods: Problem 2-2\n",
      "Do problem 2-2.  It asks you to compare the simple integration, your trapezoid integration, and the built-in Simpson's methods. It asks you to explore the behavior of the method on several functions as you vary the size of dx (or number of steps N).  Probably the best way to do this is to loop over the number of steps, calculate the value of the integral, and plot the results so you can see how they vary with N.  Intuitively, we expect the value of the integral to converge to a value as we increase the number of slices.  The question asks you to determine about how many slices are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've established what the asymptotic value of the integral (e.g. the \"true\" value), you can do what we showed in class on Wed to plot the accuracy vs. the number of slices. From these plots you can determine how the accuracy depends on N (or dx).\n",
      "\n",
      "To help you do this, go back to the \"Chapter 2 - Integration\" notebook and look at the plots of accuracy vs N for the Trapezoid and Simpson's methods.  Which increases accuracy faster?  How fast does each go -- how do we describe them in the text?  Since these are log plots, the slope tells us the *power dependence* of accuracy on N.  That is, a slope of -2 means accuracy goes as $N^{-2}$. With this knowledge, characterize how the accuracy depends on N for each integration method you use here.  Compare to what is written on p. 65 in the text."
